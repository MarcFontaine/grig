The way grig interacts with hamlib is controled via command line options. Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.TP 
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-model\fR=\fIID\fR
select radio model number; see \fB\-\-list\fR
.TP 
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-rig\-file\fR=\fIDEVICE\fR
set device of the radio, eg. /dev/ttyS0
.TP 
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-speed\fR=\fIBAUD\fR
set transfer rate (serial port only)
.TP 
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-civ\-addr\fR=\fIID\fR
set CI\-V address (decimal, ICOM only)
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR=\fILEVEL\fR
set hamlib debug level (0..5)
.TP 
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
list supported radios and exit
.TP

show version information and exit
.PP 
\fBExample:\fR
Start grig using YAESU FT\-990 connected to the first serial port,
using 4800 baud and debug level set to warning:
.PP 
     grig \-m 116 \-r /dev/ttyS0 \-s 4800 \-d 3
.PP 
or if you prefer the long options:
.PP 
     grig \-\-model=116 \-\-rig\-file=/dev/ttyS0 \-\-speed=4800 \-\-debug=3
.PP 
It is usually enough to specify the model ID and the DEVICE.
.PP 
If you start grig without any options it will use the Dummy backend
and set the debug level to 0 (RIG_DEBUG_NONE). If you do not specify
the transfer rate for the serial port, the default serial speed will
be used by the backend and even if you specify a value, it can be
overridden by the backend. If you omit the radio device (port)
grig will use \fI/dev/ttyS0\fR or \fIlocalhost\fR if the selected
radio is RPC\-rig.

.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.TP 
Connection settings
Once you have started grig you can not change the radio settings (model, device,
speed). You will have to restart the program if you want to change any of these
settings.
.TP 
Multiple radios
Grig can control only one radio at the time. There are, however, no problems in
starting several instances of grig as long as they do not try to control the
same radio. An exception to this is the RPC\-rig backend in which case
the rpc rig daemon will act as a server while grig or any other hamlib
frontend will act as a client.
