&appname; has built in functionality for performing advanced software scans. Software scan in this context means that the tuning is done by &app; and not by the radio. In other words, rather that using the scan functionality of a particular radio, &app; will perform the frequency stepping and use the set-frequency function to tune the radio to a particular frequency.
