.\" Add any additional description here
.PP 
Grig is a simple graphical user interface for the Ham Radio Control Libraries. It is intended to be highly generic presenting the user to the same interface regardless of which radio is being controled.
.PP
The way grig interacts with hamlib is controlled via command line options. Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

\fBExample:\fR
Start grig using YAESU FT\-990 connected to the first serial port,
using 4800 baud and debug level set to warning:
.PP 
     grig \-m 116 \-r /dev/ttyS0 \-s 4800 \-d 3
.PP 
or if you prefer the long options:
.PP 
     grig \-\-model=116 \-\-rig\-file=/dev/ttyS0 \-\-speed=4800 \-\-debug=3
.PP 
It is usually enough to specify the model ID and the DEVICE.
.PP 
If you start grig without any options it will use the Dummy backend
and set the debug level to 0 (RIG_DEBUG_NONE). If you do not specify
the transfer rate for the serial port, the default serial speed will
be used by the backend and even if you specify a value, it can be
overridden by the backend. If you omit the radio device (port)
grig will use \fI/dev/ttyS0\fR or \fIlocalhost\fR if the selected
radio is RPC\-rig.

.SH "KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"
.TP
Buffer Overflow in Radio
By default, grig tries to execute rig commands as fast as possible in order to
achieve an almost real-time remote control experience. This strategy has turned out
to cause problems with some radios, probably because these radios acknowledge the
reception of a command before executing them, whereby the next command will be sent
before the previous one has terminated. To avoid any possible buffer overflow
in these situations, one can try to experiment with the -D or --debug command line
argument, which will put the specified delay in between each executed command. The
default value is 10 milliseconds and the smallest possible value is 1 millisecond
(if one specifies 0 millisecond on the command line, the default value will be used).
If you find a value which is better for your radio than the default value, please
let us know about it.
.TP
Connection Settings
Once you have started grig you can not change the radio settings (model, device,
speed). You will have to restart the program if you want to change any of these
settings.
.TP
Multiple Radios
Grig can control only one radio at the time. There are, however, no problems in
starting several instances of grig as long as they do not try to control the
same radio. An exception to this is the RPC\-rig backend in which case
the rpc rig daemon will act as a server while grig or any other hamlib
frontends will act as a clients.
.TP
Power OFF State
On some radios, grig does not cope very well with the power off state. It is yet
not known whether this is a bug in the hamlib backend or in grig and we will
definitely appreciate your input.
