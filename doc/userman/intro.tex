\subsection{About Grig}\label{subsec:about}

The idea of homogeneous interface with grig/hamlib compared to the usual
way of doing rig ctrl. One day you may decide to replace your radio, but
the computer control interface will still be the same. Functionality may

than your previous one, but once you have learned to use grig with one
radio, you will have no problems in using it with another radio either.
