Primary Objectives for this baseline:

- Continuous readback of rig settings so that rig and GUI can be used
  in parallel.

- Dependence on Gtk+ only (no more GNOME libs or GConf). Currently gtk+-2.4
  is used.

- GUI should never be influenced by hardware (no freeze nor slow response from
  GUI)

- Ability to select any rig supproted by hamlib from the command line, meaning 
  no more need for explicitly configuring a rig before beeing able to use it.
